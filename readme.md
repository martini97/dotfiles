# dotfiles

My dotfiles, focused on JavaScript/TypeScript/Python development.

## What's in the box?

* Neovim
  + Coc.nvim
  + Fzf.vim
* Tmux
* ZSH
  + Starship

## Setup

So far I haven't been able to find a nice and useful way to automatically install
the dependencies, but to install the configuration files you can use the Makefile
`stow` task.
